<p>This is the new version</p>
        <p>Clicking on a hyperlink to navigate seems simple, but in reality, it involves many steps, and the browser
            plays a
            crucial role in this process. Next, I will show you the underlying logic behind it.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5 class="orange">1. Parse the URL:</h5>
                <p>The browser will parses the URL associated with the hyperlink to determine its destination(which is
                    the
                    attribute of <code>href = " "</code>), of course it includes resolving relative URLs to their
                    absolute
                    counterparts so that anchor links will work.
                </p>
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <h5 class="orange">2. Formulate an HTTP Request:</h5>
                <p>The browser then formulates an <a data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#http_info"
                        href="#">HTTP</a>
                    <a data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#get_info" href="#">GET</a> (You
                    can
                    click on HTTP or GET to get more information) request for the
                    resource. This request includes:
                    <!-- Using bs5 to make the information about http collapsibles  -->
                <p id="get_info" class="collapse text-warning">
                    Just think about an HTTP request as your browser connecting to the server and either asking for a
                    specific
                    resource or
                    sending data to it. And there exist several http request types, like get,post,put,etc. But in the
                    context of
                    hyperlinks, get is the most common type; A GET request asks the server for a specific piece of
                    information
                    or resource. When you connect to a website, your
                    browser usually sends several GET requests to receive the data that it needs for the page to load.
                </p>
                <p id="http_info" class="collapse text-warning">
                    HTTP is a protocol. In fact, the acronym stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. This protocol
                    governs
                    the
                    structure and
                    language of the requests and responses that take place between clients and servers. The clients are
                    usually
                    web
                    browsers, but they can come in many forms, such as search engine robots.

                    When you visit websites through a browser, the entire connection takes place via HTTP. The protocol
                    enables
                    you to
                    receive data, including text, images, videos, stylesheets, scripts, and more.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The URL of the resource.</li>
                    <li>Headers that provide context about the request, such as the user-agent (browser type), accepted
                        languages,and more.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>


            </li><br>
            <li>
                <h5 class="orange">3: Send the Request to the Server:</h5>
                <p>Send the request to the server which contains target resuorces.
                </p>
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <h5 class="orange">4: Receive and Process the Server Response:</h5>
                <p>The server responds with an HTTP response, which includes a status code (like 200 for a successful
                    request)
                    and the
                    requested content. And then the browser process this response in different ways:
                    <a href="#" title="Dismissible popover" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-trigger="focus"
                        data-bs-html="true"
                        data-bs-content="1.If the content is an HTML page, the browser renders it. <br> 2. If it's a downloadable file, the browser may download it or ask the user how to proceed, based on the content-type header and browser settings.">Show
                        that:</a>

                </p>
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <h5 class="orange">5: Render the Content:</h5>
                <p>For HTML content, the browser parses the HTML and CSS, constructing the DOM (Document Object Model)
                    and
                    rendering the
                    page for the user to view.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can see that a simple click requires going through so many steps to achieve its final effect.
        </p>
        <button class="btn btn-warning return">RETURN</button>
    </div>

    <script>
        // reload the window to back to the main interface
        $(".return").click(function () {
            window.location.reload();
        });

        var popoverTriggerList = [].slice.call(document.querySelectorAll('[data-bs-toggle="popover"]'))
        var popoverList = popoverTriggerList.map(function (popoverTriggerEl) {
            return new bootstrap.Popover(popoverTriggerEl)
        })
    </script>
