                <p>
                    As a web developerüßë‚Äçüíª, hyperlinks are undoubtedly a powerful tool. You can use the &lt;a&gt;
                    (anchor) tag to
                    create hyperlinks, and the "href" attribute within this tag will determine the type of the
                    hyperlink.</p>

                        <p>You can use internal links to direct users to different pages within the same website. And
                            the code is
                            like this: <code>&lt;a href="/localfile.html"&gt;dwqdqwdqw&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here I well give you an example: click on this <a href="./internal_link.html"
                                class="true_link">hyperlink</a>.
                            This

                        <p>External links allow you to conveniently jump to other websites, and they are very useful for
                            accessing
                            external
                            resources and interacting or collaborating with other sites. And the code is

                        </p>
                        <p>Here is the example: click on this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink"
                                class="true_link">hyperlink</a>. This
                            hyperlink string
                            will lead you to the webpage of hyperlinks' Wikipedia. And you can easily return by clicking

                        <p>Anchor links can significantly enhance the user experience of the current page by allowing
                            for quick

                            content they are
                            interested in.
                            Additionally, they offer benefits such as optimizing SEO and increasing interactivity. And
                            the code is
                            like this:
                            <code>&lt;a href="#example"&gt;dwqdqwdqw&lt;/a&gt;</code>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here is the example: click on this <a href="#thirdP" class="true_link"
                                id="anchor_3">hyperlink</a>. This
                            hyperlink string

                <p>
                    From the examples and explanations above, you should be able to appreciate the charm of hyperlinks.
                    Web developers are primarily the designers and users of hyperlinks. Next, you can click the return
                    button below
                    and
                    head to the browser section to see how hyperlinks are implemented in the context of browsers.</p>

                    crucial role in this process. Next, I will show you the underlying logic behind it.</p>

                            Just think about an HTTP request as your browser connecting to the server and either asking

                            hyperlinks, get is the most common type; A GET request asks the server for a specific piece

                            information
                            or resource. When you connect to a website, your
                            browser usually sends several GET requests to receive the data that it needs for the page to
                            load.

                            HTTP is a protocol. In fact, the acronym stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. This
